A stylized logo for the Path Finder Puzzle app. The image should depict a simple maze grid with a small icon of a person or a dot at the starting position (top‑left corner) and a larger icon at the exit (bottom‑right corner). The maze should be drawn in a clean, minimal style with light gray walls and white background. The start icon should be a small blue dot, the exit icon a larger red dot. The overall design should be simple, modern, and suitable for use as a website logo.
